## Sponsor Challenges

### Web3Auth

We are exclusively using Web3Auth as the main mode of login and authentication for our application. Using Web3Auth, we are able to allow users to easily on-board our platform with a crypto wallet, letting them directly have access to purchase NFTs that have loyalty rewards.

We improve the current system by creating a binding/mapping feature that binds existing wallets to the Web3Auth account. This is useful for users who already have NFTs in another wallet.
